## Hello, I'm Ashley Martinez!

I'm currently completing my final year of a Bachelor of Applied Science in Secure Software Development. I'm actively seeking an internship or part-time opportunity in the software development or cybersecurity field.

My profile showcases a simple Baccarat program I built with a strong focus on secure user login and admin control functionality. I chose to build a casino-style application because of my experience working in the casino industry, where I have often thought about how the games I see on the floor could be programmed.

This version of the game is simplified, each hand is treated as a 50/50 chance. If I continue to develop it, I plan to implement more realistic odds based on a 6â€“7 deck shoe, with proper shuffling and card tracking to simulate a live Baccarat table more accurately.

The core focus of this project, however, is not game complexity, it is security with loging in to the application. This program demonstrates key secure development practices, including:

- Password hashing
- Login attempt tracking and account lockouts
- Password strength validation
- Role-based access control (Admin, Player, Auditor)
- Secure SQLite database interactions

Thank you for checking out my project!
